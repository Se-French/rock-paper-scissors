Create a rock-paper-scissors game

With the javascript skills I've been learning, I created a simple rock-paper-scissors game which runs in the browser console. 

The game runs through 5 rounds of rock-paper-scissors (player against computer), returning the result of each round and then declaring the winner of the game.

I later edited the game to be able to be played in a UI and added style with CSS.
